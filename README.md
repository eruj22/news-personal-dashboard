<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This app is your personal dashboard. In first few pages you input your name and select topics that you wish to view. Based on these you get personalized news on the main page. You can click on each news section to view modal with more details. On the main page you also get current weather based on your location from IP. Additionally, you get a picture of the day based on most popular picture from Pixabay.

Note: link to the production app isn't available, because I would need to pay for production use of NewsAPI.

### Built With

The project is build with these technologies:

- React
- SASS
- React Icons
- APIs: NewsAPI, OpenWeather, Pixabay and Geoapify

### Possible improvements

The app can be improved in a few ways:

- In the news modal there could be longer news article by paying for better API package
- I could also implement search function, to get specific news
